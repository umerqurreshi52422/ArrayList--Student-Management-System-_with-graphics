Mini PRoject __ Student Managemnet System

README File
This code implements a simple ArrayList data structure to store and manage student data. The ArrayList allows users to insert students at the end of the ArrayList, at a specified index, or after a student with a given registration number. The ArrayList also has methods to check if it is full or empty and to resize it if necessary.


Requirements
This code requires a C++ compiler to run. It has been tested on Windows using the Visual Studio compiler.


Usage
The arraylist class defines the ArrayList data structure and provides several methods to manage it. The student struct defines the data structure for each student.

When the program is run, it asks the user to enter the size of the ArrayList. The user can then choose from several options:

    Insert a student at the end of the ArrayList
    Insert a student at a specified index in the ArrayList
    Insert a student after a student with a specified registration number
    Exit the program

If the ArrayList is full and the user tries to insert a new student, the ArrayList is automatically resized to double its current size.
